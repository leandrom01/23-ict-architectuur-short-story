# DIT IS MIJN GLOEDNIEUWE SHORT STORY
Autheur: Leandro Delgado Monteiro

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled deep in the mountains, there lived a young girl named Mei. She was known throughout the village for her kind heart and gentle nature. One day, as she was wandering through the forest, she came across a wounded bird lying on the ground.

Without hesitation, Mei scooped up the bird and cradled it in her arms. She took the bird back to her home and spent countless hours nursing it back to health. As the days passed, Mei grew increasingly attached to the bird, and she knew that she could never let it go.

One day, as Mei and the bird were sitting outside, enjoying the warmth of the sun, a group of hunters appeared in the village. They had come to hunt for the rarest and most beautiful bird in the land, and they were willing to pay a large sum of money to anyone who could find it.

Mei knew that her bird was the one the hunters were looking for, and she knew that they would stop at nothing to get it. So she made a decision - she would risk everything to keep her beloved bird safe.

In the dead of night, Mei snuck out of her home and set off into the mountains, with the bird tucked safely in her arms. For days, she traveled through treacherous terrain, with only her determination to guide her.

Finally, she reached a hidden cave deep in the heart of the mountains. There, she built a small nest for her bird and settled in, determined to protect it from the hunters who would stop at nothing to find it.

Years passed, and Mei and the bird grew old together in the safety of their mountain home. They spent their days exploring the beauty of the mountains, and their nights curled up together in the warmth of the nest.

And though Mei knew that she had risked everything to keep her beloved bird safe, she knew that it had been worth it, for the love that they shared was the greatest treasure of all.
